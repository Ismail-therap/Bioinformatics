=== Use Linux inside Windows ======
===========================

1. Go to Turn Windows features on or off:

Check mark 2 things: Virtual Machine Platform and Windows Subsystem for Linux

2. Go to Microsoft store and install your required Linux subsystem (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian, Kali etc... whatever you need)

3. For me after clicking I got this error: 

"installing, this may take a few minutes... wslregisterdistribution failed with error: 0x800701bc error: 0x800701bc wsl 2 requires an update to its kernel component. for information please visit https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel"

Solved by downloading and installing from this source: https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi

4. Setting Username and password by clicking on the Linux terminal after that. 

5.
